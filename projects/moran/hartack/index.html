          <span class="dropcap-i">I</span>n any other year, Iron Liege would 
          have been an imposing favorite in the Kentucky Derby. But 1957 was no 
          ordinary year, a year of plenty in a generation of three-year-olds 
          that viewed now, in the context of a half-century of perspective, may 
          have been the most deeply talented in history.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He was by Bull Lea, from a mare by War Admiral, named Iron Maiden. 
          From this fateful mating, he inherited his maternal 
          grandfather&rsquo;s speed. and his maternal grandfather, 
          himself a son of none other than Man o&rsquo; War, was the fourth winner of 
          the Triple Crown two decades earlier while running his overmatched 
          opponents off their feet in Louisville, Baltimore and New York. Yet 
          among those who were expected to face the starter in the 83rd running 
          of the Derby, Iron Liege was regarded as a pacemaker for stablemate 
          Gen. Duke, the favorite in perhaps the strongest field ever assembled 
          at the threshold of the Triple Crown.
        </p>
        <p>   
          A wealth of three-year-old talent of this magnitude beneath the colors 
          of a single owner is unimaginable nowadays. In those days, it could  
          happen only in the resplendently purple genetic pool in residence at 
          Calumet Farm, but racing does not spare even its legends the 
          occasional detour;, the strange twist of fate on Derby Day. Trainer 
          Ben Jones found Gen. Duke injured that morning and was forced to 
          declare the favorite scratched. In his absence, the great Bold Ruler, 
          a most- worthy successor, ascended to the favorite&rsquo;s pedestal at 6-5 
          with living legend Eddie Arcaro in the stirrups.  Round Table and 
          Gallant Man were next, both at slightly more than 5-2.  Iron Liege, at 
          more than 8-1 in a field of nine, was dismissed as a rabbit without a 
          mission, just behind Federal Hill with four others written off as rank 
          longshots.

        <p class="dropcap">
          <span class="dropcap-t">T</span>he task of setting the table for his 
          stablemate no longer the afternoon&rsquo;s assignment, Iron Liege was rated 
          just off the pace, a threat at every stride for a mile. The War 
          Admiral and Man o&rsquo; War blood combined with his Calumet heritage was 
          manifesting itself in Iron Liege when an upwardly mobile 
          young jockey, riding in only his second Kentucky Derby, sent him after 
          Federal Hill and turned a stalking trip into a narrow lead leaving the 
          quarter pole.          
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Behind Iron Liege, the English-bred Gallant Man, having been reserved 
          well behind the early pace, was in determined pursuit beneath Bill 
          Shoemaker, by then a Derby veteran with a victory in 1955 aboard Swaps 
          on his resume. At the eighth pole, Gallant Man was at Iron Liege&rsquo;s 
          flank and bearing down.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
          Amidst the rising heat of battle, with Gallant Man and Iron Liege on 
          even terms, Shoemaker stood up, mistaking the sixteenth pole for the 
          final post. It was a brief interruption of Gallant Man&rsquo;s long, fluid 
          stride; the blink of an eye, but it was the difference in a nose 
          decision that went to Iron Liege in a stretch drive that would go down 
          in history alongside the storied fighting finish of 1933, when Don 
          Mead and Herb Fisher flailed at one another while Brokers Tip and Head 
          Play settled the decision in a more conventional, if no less hotly 
          contested, manner.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          William John Hartack dismounted Iron Liege, his role in a Derby that 
          would haunt Shoemaker for years and his first winning ride having 
          secured a place in racing history, and said only: &ldquo;This son of a gun 
          can really run.&rdquo;
        </p>
        
        <p> 
          Bill Hartack, even then, addressed the racing press (if he addressed 
          them at all) through a curt sneer without inclination to fulfill 
          dutifully the obligations of celebrity. <span class="quote">&ldquo;I 
          admire the racing writers,&rdquo;</span> he once said with unveiled 
          contempt. <span class="quote">&ldquo;It must be tough to write about 
          something you know nothing about.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        
        <p> 
          He viewed the world and most with whom he grudgingly shared the planet 
          from behind a stone wall. Hartack was described at various times as 
          obstreperous, bad-tempered, defiant, quarrelsome, fractious, 
          confrontational and, if only in the flush of an important victory, 
          charming and gregarious. In an age when athletes were polite to a 
          fault, Hartack would be considered rude even by today's standards.           
        </p>
        
        <div class="collage" id="collage-1960">
          <h2>1960 Venetian Way</h2>
          <img src="i/collage.1960.jpg" alt="1960 - Venetian Way" width="870" height="724" />  
        </div>
        
        <p class="dropcap">
          <span class="dropcap-h">H</span>e had no friends among fellow jockeys  
          and few in the racing community. Yet, that uncompromising, me-against-
          the-world loner nature may have been the source of his greatness. He 
          enjoyed hunting and fishing, flashy cars and stylish clothes. After 
          that, life was about winning races.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before Hartack made his debut in the Kentucky Derby on Fabius, the 
          runner-up to Needles in 1956, Arcaro, <span class="quote">&ldquo;The 
          Master,&rdquo;</span> had been astride five three-year-olds who stood 
          in the shadow of the Twin Spires draped in roses on the first Saturday 
          of May, a record that 
          towered above all other jockeys and to this day has been equaled only 
          by Hartack, whose fifth victory, aboard Majestic Prince, was 39 years 
          ago. But for misfortune, Hartack would have won a sixth Derby, but, in 
          1958, suffered a broken leg that cost him the mount on Tim Tam, the 
          winner of the first two legs of the Triple Crown for Calumet that 
          year. No active rider has partnered more than two winners of the 
          Derby. Shoemaker rode four winners from 26 mounts. Isaac Murphy, Earl 
          Sande, Angel Cordero Jr. and Gary Stevens retired with four Derby 
          victories each.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enigmatic man who would equal Arcaro&rsquo;s Kentucky Derby record and 
          come to be called by some the greatest rider of the 20th century
          needed only a dozen mounts to do it, nine of which came after 
          his 1959 induction to the Racing Hall of Fame. Arcaro, in contrast, 
          rode 21 Derby starters.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Iron Liege, Hartack would be without a mount in the next 
          Kentucky Derby.  He won the 1960 Derby edition with Venetian Way, 
          watched the race without a mount in 1961, won the 1962 Derby with 
          Decidedly, did not have a mount in 1963, and won the 1964 Derby with 
          Northern Dancer.  In a span of 19 years, Hartack, though in great 
          demand, rode in consecutive runnings of the Kentucky Derby only five 
          times, winning his fifth, in 1969, aboard Majestic Prince after having 
          ridden only two Derby starters in the five-year span that followed 
          Northern Dancer&rsquo;s victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he missed the occasional Derby and other important races, trainers 
          and their owners willing to forego diplomacy and weather the 
          occasional verbal whipping sought out Hartack for his 
          horsemanship, cunning, skill and an unbent determination.  He was a 
          brilliant tactician, had a mystical communication with the horses he 
          rode, and possessed unflappable patience and uncanny timing that put him at the top 
          of his profession quickly, leading the nation&rsquo;s riders in his third 
          season as a jockey, and permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="quote">&ldquo;My biggest problem isn't mounts, but 
          Billy's personality,&rdquo;</span> Chick Lang, Hartack&rsquo;s agent 
          during the best years of his career and later general manager of 
          Pimlico, told Time magazine in 1958. The story was carried in an 
          issue that featured an unsmiling, severe portrait of Hartack on the 
          cover. <span class="quote">&ldquo;I spend most of my time trailing 
          around after him, apologizing to people he's insulted. He's 
          particularly rude if he hasn't won. He's the most competitive athlete 
          I ever saw.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hartack&rsquo;s brilliance on horseback is a matter of record. His view of 
          the world is a mystery that accompanied him to the grave.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p class="dropcap">
          <span class="dropcap-h">H</span>artack, who never married, died of a 
          heart attack late last November as he had lived, alone.  His life 
          traversed the a full circle in 74 years from a barely heated 
          three-room cabin in the hard-scuffle Pennsylvania soft-coal mining 
          country to a hunting cabin in southern Texas. He may have died without 
          ever having fully enjoyed his accomplishments. If he did, he kept it 
          to himself.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Writer Jimmy Breslin speculated during the ‘60s that the trials of his 
          youth may have shaped Hartack&rsquo;s view of the world. Breslin wrote, in 
          True magazine:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="quote">&ldquo;The shack was on stilts so the floor 
          wouldn&rsquo;t be against the ground in wintertime. But it didn't 
          matter because when you went out to the creek for drinking water and 
          brought it back in a basin, the way Bill Hartack had to before dinner 
          every night, any of it that would drip on the floor quickly turned to 
          ice. A pot-bellied stove was the only warm thing in shack number 371 
          and this does not constitute a heating system, even for a tiny 
          three-room shack. But it was all they had because Hartack&rsquo;s 
          father worked the soft coal in the mines around Colver, Pennsylvania, 
          and there was no money in this. Nor was there much of a life in the 
          shack. Hartack&rsquo;s mother had been killed when he was seven and he 
          had to raise his two sisters while his father dug coal. You always 
          remember this when you tell about Bill Hartack.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the rough edges were not smoothed by success, neither were they 
          softened by age. In the twilight of his career, Hartack, in 1977, 
          accepted an offer to ride on retainer in Hong Kong for an Irish owner 
          named Frank Carr. The relationship was tempestuous, as were his 
          relationships with other riders there, particularly an Australian, 
          Gary Moore, the dominant rider in Hong Kong at the time.  
          <span class="quote">&ldquo;Before I leave, I'm going to hit that guy 
          so hard his head is going to go through his locker and come out the 
          other side,&rdquo;</span> Hartack told a Hong Kong writer. He left in 
          1980 before the threat became reality, leaving in his small apartment 
          hundreds of unopened letters, bills and an assortment of ignored mail.

        <p class="dropcap">
          <span class="dropcap-w">W</span>hen he retired after the season of 
          1980, Hartack had ridden 4,272 winners from 21,535 mounts, led the 
          nation in races won four times and was the first rider to have purse 
          earnings of $3 million in a season. His place in history was, even 
          then, iconic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hartack returned to the United States and began a new career as a 
          steward at tracks in Chicago and Louisiana. In a rare interview at The 
          Fair Grounds with Jennie Rees, of the Louisville 
          Courier-Journal, an aging Hartack spoke with unusual candor.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="quote">&ldquo;On the race track, you're going to lose 
          more than you win,&rdquo;</span> Hartack said. &ldquo;But the point is, 
          once you believe that and condition yourself to saying, 
          <span class="quote">`'Aw, well, I was supposed to lose that one,' then 
          of course you can't win that one in between. I think the only way you 
          can win as many times as you possibly can is to take the premise you 
          can win them all…  [I] never really had a good day at the race track 
          - not one.  "Let's put it this way, it wasn't conducive to enjoying 
          yourself. But who cares? That was my job. . .  I liked the job. I 
          didn't enjoy it, but if I had to pick one, that was perfect. I was 
          outdoors. I had a challenge. I loved the competition. But I was 
          intolerable from the time I went to the race track until the races 
          were over.  "When I say it was torture, it didn't stop me from 
          enjoying myself at night and things like that. But I had to have a 
          buffer between my job, my profession and my social life. When the 
          races were over, there was just no way in the world I could leave the 
          race track and live with the human race. Impossible. So, depending on 
          how angry I was or how unsatisfied I was or how I could wind myself 
          down, I either went for a ride, took in a movie or went home among a 
          few friends who didn't dare ever mention the races."</span>
