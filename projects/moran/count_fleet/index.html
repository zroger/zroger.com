    	<p class="intro">
    		Imagine a year without the Kentucky Derby. Far from being the premise of a 
    		bleak futuristic novel, or a flight of sci-fi fantasy in an alternate 
    		universe, it nearly happened in 1943. Confronted by the crushing demands 
    		that World War IIÂ  placed upon both transportation and vital materials, 
        federal authorities suggested that the historic <span class="q">"Run for the Roses"</span> be 
        scrapped that year. Were it not for the shrewd energies of Col. Matt Winn, 
        the legendary Churchill Downs supremo who responded swiftly to meet the 
        government's concerns, Derby lore would have been deprived of one of its 
        greatest champions, Count Fleet.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Count Fleet was a fine proof of the axiom that appearances can be deceiving. 
        Concealed within his smallish, unprepossessing frame was speed of the 
        highest order, matched by boundless stamina and an eccentric willfulness 
        that gave his handlers fits in his younger days. If this member of the 
        equine nobility had a coat of arms, it would be emblazoned with the motto, 
        <span class="q">"Full steam ahead."</span>
    	</p>
    	<p>
        The brown colt's odyssey begins with his sire, 1928 Kentucky Derby hero 
        Reigh Count, who caught the attention of John Hertz at Saratoga the summer 
        before his classic success. Hertz, the entrepreneur of Yellow Cab Company 
        and Hertz Rent-a-Car fame, marveled at Reigh Count's fiercely competitive 
        spirit on display in a maiden contest. Storming from far off the pace, Reigh 
        Count drew alongside the leader at the sixteenth-pole, leaned over and sank 
        his teeth into his rival, before surging to victory. Hertz decided then and 
        there to purchase Reigh Count privately.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Reigh Count would reward Hertz's insight into his character. Sporting the 
        yellow silks of Mrs. Fannie Hertz, in whose name all the Hertz horses were 
        campaigned, the chestnut went on to become Horse of the Year in 1928. Reigh 
        Count shipped to England in 1929 and performed with distinction, garnering 
        the prestigious Coronation Cup at Epsom. At stud, he transmitted great 
        staying capacity, but his progeny tended to be later-developing types who 
        lacked speed. Even when Reigh Count's statistics as a sire began to decline, 
        Hertz kept the faith and continued to send a few mares to him each season.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        One of those mares was a black speedball named Quickly, who won 32 of 85 
        starts while competing in much less exalted company than Reigh Count had. 
        Enamored of her pedigree, Hertz bought the daughter of Haste, believing that 
        she would supply the early dash that Reigh Count lacked. His forecast was 
        prophetic, but much time would elapse before the fulfillment.
    	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section2" class="section light">
      <div class="bumper" style="width:77px;height:204px;"></div>
      <div class="bumper" style="width:155px;height:135px;"></div>
      <div class="bumper" style="width:75px;height:292px;"></div>
    	<p>
        Quickly visited the court of Reigh Count in 1939, several months before the 
        German invasion of Poland ignited World War II in Europe. The following 
        spring, on March 24, 1940, Count Fleet was foaled at Stoner Creek Stud near 
        Paris, Kentucky, but his entrance into the world was far from impressive. 
        The colt was small and sparely made, and his austere looks did not improve 
        as he progressed from weanling to yearling in 1941. Indeed, Hertz put him up 
        for sale that year. The price tag on Count Fleet was set at $4,500, but 
        although a number of horsemen looked him over, there were no takers, and he 
        remained in the Hertz fold. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
        As war raged halfway round the globe, with the Nazi blitzkrieg penetrating 
        deep into the Russian heartland, Count Fleet began his eventful education. 
        The exuberant colt was difficult to control, and his antics, though not 
        intended to be harmful, were at times downright dangerous for the people 
        around him. Still, in the midst of Count Fleet's quirks, bucks, lurches and 
        eccentricities, his first exercise rider, stable hand Sam Ransom, sensed a 
        serious talent, which Hertz recalled in his Racing Memoirs:
    	</p>
    	<p>
        <span class="q">"Mr. Hertz, don't ever sell that leggy, brown colt," 
        Ransom advised. "He has tried to kill me in every way I know of, not out 
        of meanness, but he sure has brushed me up against every tree and barn 
        on the place that he could. Mr. Hertz, when that leggy, brown colt wants 
        to run, he can just about fly."</span>
    	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section3" class="section light right">
      <div class="bumper" style="width:440px;height:688px;"></div>
    	<p>
        Decades later, Ransom recounted a very different version of the tale. 
        According to Ransom, he actually approached Mrs. Hertz with the advice not 
        to sell Count Fleet, and Hertz was none too pleased with his meddling. 
        Indeed, Hertz told him flatly not to volunteer such thoughts again.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Count Fleet was slated to take part in the first trial of the Hertz 
        yearlings in November of 1941, weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor 
        plunged the United States into war. Unfortunately, he was forced to sit on 
        the sidelines with a common malady for youngsters, a bucked shin.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        In early 1942, Count Fleet was sent to trainer Don Cameron in New York. In 
        an effort to curb the colt's idiosyncratic behavior, he was fitted with 
        blinkers during his exercise, but it was only a partial help. His regular 
        rider, Hall of Famer John Longden, later recalled that Hertz was again 
        trying to sell Count Fleet, worried that the problem colt could wind up 
        hurting his jockey. This time, it was Longden who issued a ringing 
        endorsement of Count Fleet, persuading Hertz to keep him.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        After finishing runner-up in his first two outings, Count Fleet began to 
        learn what was required of him. He broke through with back-to-back victories 
        by a combined nine lengths and was promptly regarded as the best 
        two-year-old in the East. Just when it looked like he was putting it all 
        together, however, Count Fleet threw in the worst effort of his career in 
        the Futurity S. at Belmont Park, winding up a distant third. Longden and 
        Hertz offered a colorful explanation for his non-performance. They believed 
        that he was more interested in hanging around the filly, second-place 
        finisher Askmenow, than he was in racing. Other observers discounted that 
        theory. Just days before the race, Count Fleet had drilled six furlongs in a 
        mind-boggling 1:08 1/5, near world-record time in his day, and may have been 
        feeling the effects of that move.
    	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section4" class="section light">
    	<p>
        Whatever torpedoed <span class="q">"The Fleet"</span> in the Futurity, he would never again taste 
        defeat. The Hertz colt first perfected the art of front running next time 
        out in the Champagne S., romping by six lengths in a sensational 1:34 4/5 
        for the mile at Belmont Park. Not only did he set a new track record, but he 
        also established a new world record for a juvenile at the distance. In rapid 
        succession followed similar demolition jobs in an allowance event at old 
        Jamaica, the Pimlico Futurity and the Walden S., embarrassing his opponents 
        by 30 lengths in the latter despite throwing a shoe.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        So completely had The Count annihilated his competition, that he was 
        assigned a staggering 132 pounds on the Experimental Free Handicap. No 
        horse, before or since, has ever been so highly rated in this annual 
        assessment of the two-year-old crop, published since 1933. Needless to say, 
        he also garnered champion two-year-old honors.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Meanwhile, as Count Fleet was sweeping all before him in the late autumn of 
        1942, the American armed forces were engaged in fierce fighting in the 
        Pacific, a new theater of operations had just commenced in North Africa, and 
        a landing on European soil was envisaged for the following year. The home 
        front was of critical importance for the waging of total war. Accordingly, 
        such critical commodities as gasoline were rationed, and the transportation 
        infrastructure was geared to wartime necessities. Therein lay the federal 
        government's concerns about the 1943 Kentucky Derby. If the typical 
        out-of-town crowd tried to get to Louisville, Kentucky, for the first 
        Saturday in May, it would probably cause all manner of headaches for the war 
        effort.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Against this backdrop, Joseph B. Eastman, director of the Office of Defense 
        Transportation, declared over the winter, <span class="q dark">"It would be better from a 
        transportation stand- point if the Kentucky Derby were not run this year."</span>
    	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section5" class="section right">
      <div class="bumper" style="width:560px;height:900px;"></div>
      <div class="bumper" style="width:505px;height:450px;"></div>
    
    	<p>
        The very suggestion was anathema to the larger-than-life Winn, the Churchill 
        Downs president who had transformed the May classic from a low-profile 
        affair into the show-stopping extravaganza that we know today. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
        "The Kentucky Derby will be run in 1943, even if there are only two horses 
        in the race, and only a half-dozen people in the stands," he promised.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        The impresario was determined to stage the 69th Derby, preserving its 
        unbroken line of renewals since 1875, but in a way that would resolve 
        Eastman's worries at a single stroke. Winn averred that it would be held for 
        locals only, eliminating the need for additional transportation, and 
        out-of-towners who already had tickets would be able to turn them in for a 
        refund. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
        As Winn would go on to proclaim, <span class="q2">"We felt it our obligation to the 
        Thoroughbred racing and breeding industry, and to those red-blooded boys who 
        are fighting so magnificently to preserve American ideals and institutions, 
        to maintain the continuity of the Kentucky Derby."</span>
    	</p>
      <p>
        <br/>
      </p>
    	<p>
        Hence, with the burden of excess train travel effectively removed, Eastman 
        spared the 1943 Derby. Considering Hertz's automotive background, and his 
        wartime service as a transportation adviser to the government, it would have 
        been the height of irony if his star colt were denied his chance of glory 
        because of transportation issues.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Wartime restrictions affected many other race meetings, and in the process, 
        Count Fleet's sophomore campaign. With the old Tropical Park closing early 
        on January 8 because of gasoline rationing, wintering in Florida was not an 
        option. Instead, Cameron shipped the colt, who was still small but started 
        to fill out, to Oaklawn Park to gear up for his assault on the classics. 
    	</p>
    </div>

    <div id="section6" class="section light">      
    	<p>
        Count Fleet returned to New York in the spring, and in a time-honored 
        tradition of racing pundits, the question was raised whether he would pick 
        up where he left off, or add his name to the list of juvenile flashes in the 
        pan. He answered in thundering fashion. After coasting home in an allowance 
        on April 13, he cruised by 3 1/2 lengths four days later in the Wood 
        Memorial, then contested at Jamaica. Despite being throttled down by 
        Longden, The Fleet clocked 1 1/16 miles in 1:43, shattering the stakes 
        record by more than two seconds and nearly eclipsing the track mark. His 
        performance was all the more incredible because he had been slammed by a 
        rival at the start, slicing a gash just above his left hind hoof, and blood 
        was trickling from the wound.
    	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section7" class="section light">
    	<p>
        An eerily similar injury had befallen his sire just before the Derby, and 
        only after round-the-clock veterinary efforts did Reigh Count make it to the 
        post in 1928. Count Fleet's Derby hopes, once rescued from the imperatives 
        of war, now hung in the balance again. He shipped to Louisville on April 19, 
        and upon arrival, esteemed Daily Racing Form writer Charles Hatton thought 
        the colt's left hind foot looked <span class="q">"mangled."</span> 
    	</p>
    	<p>
        The Count needed the latest therapies to treat his gash, ward off such 
        potentially serious complications as infection, and ensure his date with 
        destiny beneath the Twin Spires. Part of the coronary band, and the hoof 
        wall, were pared away; sulfanilamide was applied as a topical treatment; 
        ice, the old tried-and-true remedy, was also invoked; and the area was 
        wrapped with a protective bandage. Through it all, Count Fleet appeared 
        sound while training at Churchill, and Hatton, who reported meticulously on 
        the hoof situation, observed that the wound was looking better as the days 
        passed. The champion's connections spoke of their confidence.
    	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section8" class="section light">
    	<p>
        <span class="q">"I feel that if the race is at all truly run, it will 
        not be close,"</span> Longden 
        prophesied. "The colt loves to run, and he can run. They say he is not much 
        to look at, but he looks mighty good from where I sit when he falls into 
        that long stride."
    	</p>
    	<p>
        The fans agreed, and they pounded Count Fleet into 2-5 favoritism in the 
        "Streetcar Derby," so called because of the most accessible manner of 
        getting to the track in those straitened times. Without the out-of-towners 
        -- notably the celebrities, politicians and paragons of high society -- the 
        clubhouse dining room was less densely occupied, and it was also noted that 
        there were fewer people milling around the infield. Still, the crowd 
        officially numbered 61,700, and conspicuous among them were members of the 
        armed forces. Indeed, some were given tickets by generous out-of-town 
        boxholders, who preferred to support the troops instead of pocketing their 
        refunds.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        As the Blood-Horse put it, "The Derby had its color, but it was a new color 
        -- khaki."
        <br/>
    	</p>
    	<p>
        The khaki was not only represented at the track. Servicemen were able to 
        listen to the race via radio broadcast beamed to far-flung corners of the 
        globe. 
    	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section9" class="section">
    	<p>
        Hopes were high among some spectators that, given Count Fleet's penchant for 
        blazing speed, he could set a new record time. What they did not know, 
        however, was that his hoof injury, though progressing nicely, had still 
        altered his training timetable. As Hertz revealed in his memoirs, Count 
        Fleet had been forced to skip at least one key work in the lead-up to the 
        Derby.
    	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section10" class="section">
    	<p>
        Short on fitness or not, The Fleet set sail that May 1 and never looked 
        back, despite the fact that he raced without his left hind bandage, and in 
        the cut-and-thrust of action, his wound reopened. When the starting gate 
        sprang open in the Derby, the usual skirmishing for position ensued, and 
        passing the stands for the first time, The Fleet was momentarily bottled up 
        in traffic. That was not the place Longden wanted to be, not only for 
        tactical reasons, but because of the Hertz colt's intransigence.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        As Longden said, <span class="q">"If he didn't have racing room, he'd go to the outside or 
        just climb over horses. If you were in close quarters with him, you were in 
        trouble."</span>
    	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section11" class="section">
    	<p>
        Longden was able to slip through the blockade, and The Fleet rapidly secured 
        his favored battle station -- the lead. Gold Shower, an old opponent from 
        his rowdy juvenile days, tried to match strides with him through the first 
        half-mile in a testing :46 3/5, but Count Fleet was racing in hand, and a 
        spent Gold Shower beat a retreat. On the far turn, another familiar foe, 
        Blue Swords, who had vainly chased him in the Wood Memorial, tried to take 
        aim on Count Fleet, but the effortlessly moving target simply pulled out of 
        his range. In the stretch, the son of Reigh Count drew off to win by three 
        lengths from the valiant Blue Swords, who was himself six lengths clear of 
        third. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Count Fleet took longer to navigate the 1 1/4-mile trip than his most 
        optimistic admirers had imagined, coming home in a slow 2:04 and prompting 
        Hatton to say that the Streetcar Derby was run in "streetcar time." The 
        Count must have taken umbrage at that, for in his three remaining starts, 
        he set or flirted with stakes-record times.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Just one week later, on May 8, Count Fleet lined up for the 1 3/16-mile 
        Preakness S. and turned in an even more commanding performance. Four lengths 
        in front at the first call, he widened his margin throughout, and Hatton 
        believed that the colt responded to the roar of the Pimlico crowd by surging 
        eight lengths clear at the wire. Among those cheering fans was Ransom, now 
        in the Army and based in Maryland. A thoughtful Mrs. Hertz made it possible 
        for him, his Army pals and his commanding officer to enjoy the race, and a 
        victory celebration to boot. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Poor Blue Swords, whose quaint weaponry was always going to be outgunned by 
        The Fleet, was second once more. He pulled up sore and did not try to take 
        on his conqueror again. In the absence of Blue Swords, the Hertz colt faced 
        only two opponents in the one-mile Withers S. on May 22 and duly strolled by 
        five lengths in the Belmont mud.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        When Count Fleet lined up in the June 5 Belmont S., seeking a sweep of the 
        Triple Crown, all that stood between him and racing immortality was 1 1/2 miles. 
        The two hopelessly overmatched victims who went into the gate with him hardly 
        qualified as opposition. All The Fleet had to do was complete his victory lap 
        around the oval to claim the laurels. But he wanted to do so much more. Tearing 
        off at the start, the brown colt raced not against his flesh-and-blood foes, but 
        seemed to be vying with history itself. Count Fleet straightaway steamed ahead 
        by eight lengths, then 20 lengths, galloping in majestic isolation en route to a 
        stakes-record final time of 2:28 1/5. At the wire, he was officially credited 
        with a 25-length triumph. Although some felt that was a stingy approximation, it 
        was still enough to set a record margin of victory in the Belmont, a mark which 
        was eclipsed only by Secretariat's 31-length score in 1973.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Eagle-eyed observers, however, noticed that something was amiss during the 
        race. Some believed that they saw him take a bad step entering the 
        backstretch, while others glimpsed a problem in the final quarter-mile. 
        Longden likewise sensed that all was not well.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        "I felt him bobble in the stretch and knew he had hurt himself," the Hall of 
        Famer later said. "I started to pull him up, but he'd have none of it. He 
        just grabbed the bit in that bull-headed way of his and took off again."
    	</p>
    	<p>
        The Belmont proved to be a Pyrrhic victory, for Count Fleet had suffered an 
        ankle injury. The mishap was brushed aside at the time as not significant, 
        but it developed into a trickier issue than first thought. He wound up never 
        racing again, retiring with a splendid mark of 16 wins, four seconds and one 
        third from 21 starts, and $250,300 in earnings. 
    	</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section12" class="section">
    	<p>
        Hatton suggested that The Fleet may have been a casualty of the war. In an 
        effort to conserve gasoline, track maintenance was restricted to the early 
        morning hours, and the surface was not watered or harrowed between races. As 
        a result, Hatton noted that the track was "deep in dustâ¦ and of somewhat 
        uneven texture" on Belmont Day.

        Unanimously voted Horse of the Year for 1943, Count Fleet returned to Stoner 
        Creek, became a prominent stallion, and lived to the advanced age of 33. One 
        of his top sons, Count Turf, captured the Kentucky Derby in 1951, forming 
        the first three-generation series of Derby heroes. The Fleet's enduring 
        legacy, however, came courtesy of his daughters. The great Kelso, a five-
        time Horse of the Year, was out of a Count Fleet mare, and another daughter 
        of The Fleet became the granddam of the extraordinary Mr. Prospector, whose 
        sire line has enjoyed great success in the past two decades of the Run for 
        the Roses.

        In this indirect way, a faint echo of Count Fleet still sounds at Churchill 
        on the first Saturday in May, in the very race that he almost missed. 
        Neither World War II, nor a wounded hoof, were able to forestall his 
        destined glory.

        The last word belongs to Longden. Once the world's winningest jockey, he 
        went on to train 1969 Derby winner Majestic Prince, and remains the only 
        person to score Derby victories as a rider and as a trainer. In Longden's 
        appraisal, Count Fleet was the best horse he had ever laid eyes on:
