## Churchill Downs
<img src="/img/misc/churchill-downs.png" class="project-logo" />
I was part of a small team that migrated several sites off of an out-dated and
expensive publishing platform, onto Drupal.  The sites were fairly simple sites
comprised mostly of blogs and news, simple pages and custom landing pages.  The
most impressive part of the entire setup, was being able to handle the crushing
amount of traffic experienced around the Kentucky Derby.

## Sony Music

<img src="/img/misc/sony-music.png" class="project-logo" />
From 2008 to 2010, I was the lead developer for Sony Music's Drupal-powered
platform.  The platform was a highly-evolved Drupal 6 environment with custom
modules, install profile and base themes to support the needs of the artists
and labels.  When I left in 2010, there were nearly 200 sites running on the
platform, with around 3 sites being launched every week. One of the major 
accomplishments of the platform is the vast use of Drupal's 
internationalization features to provide localized environments for many of the
sites.  Some of the sites have over 20 localized environments in over a dozen
different languages. A lot of the work done for this platform made its way
into Drupal 7.

Here is a very small sampling of sites from my time there.
