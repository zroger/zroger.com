<h6 class="subheader">Hello.</h6>
## I'm Roger LÃ³pez.

I live, work and play in New York City. I consider myself a geek, in a very
broad sense of the word.  I geek out about most everything, but especially the
web, food, wine and cocktails.  To borrow a line from
<abbr title="David Hennimeier Hansen">DHH</abbr>, I am addicted to improvement.
Regardless of the activity, if I spend any time at all doing it, I will go out
of my way to learn everything I possibly can about it and improve my abilities.

### Work
I've been pushing the boundaries of Drupal since 2006.  I'm currently making
<span title="webscale?">amazing</span> websites with the brilliant people at
<a href="http://treehouseagency.com/" class="treehouse">Treehouse Agency</a>.
Previously, I worked with Sony Music, leading up a team that developed and
managed almost 200 artists' websites for the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Outkast,
Beyonce, Foo Fighters and many more.  Prior to that I built the Kentucky Derby
website on Drupal, which had to withstand enormous amounts of traffic in the
hours leading up to the race.

Although I've been solidly planted in the Drupal universe for many years, I love
to keep up with new technology.  In particular, I enjoy programming in Ruby and
Javascript, and integrating other technologies into Drupal.  This site, for
instance, is built using Jekyll, a Ruby project for generating static blogs.
I recently released my first native iOS application for DrupalCampNYC 10.

### Play
Growing up in west Texas, I have a huge appetite for mexican food (not tex-mex)
and barbeque.  I enjoy all kinds of wine, and rarely ever drink the same thing
twice.  I appreciate a properly made cocktail.  I spend most of my free time
finding new places, hanging out at my local favorites or barbecuing on my
rooftop with my lovely wife.
