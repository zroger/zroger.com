I just threw this one together, and it turned out pretty good.

<!-- break -->
<div class="item-list" markdown="1">
### Ingredients:

- Boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 4 Roma tomatoes
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 green bell pepper
- 1 large carrot
- 2 yukon gold potatoes
- Marinated, pitted olives

</div>

Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then brown on both sides in a touch of
oil.  Remove the chicken and set aside.  Sweat the onions, peppers and garlic
in the left over oil and chicken fat.  Add the chicken back to the pan, along
with the diced tomatoes, carrots and potatoes.  Season with salt and pepper,
and whatever herbs you have on hand.  I used thyme.  Let it simmer, covered for
about 15-20 minutes.  Add some chopped olives a couple of minutes before it's
done.
