After sleeping in for the first time since we started the trip, we spent a lazy
morning having a late breakfast, followed by a leisurely stroll down Via
Banchi di Sopra. Monique does a tiny amount of shopping before we head back to
the Hotel Chiusarelli to relax.  At 14:00 we will be picked up for our tour
through the countryside of Chianti.

<!-- break -->
_Ring, ring_.  Monique picks up the phone in our room.  "Buon giornno.  Grazie,
we'll be down in just a minute."  Our tour guide is ten minutes early.  We
quickly lace up our shoes, I grab my bag and we head downstairs.

In the hotel lobby, we meet Gigi, our driver and tour guide for the afternoon.
We later learn that Gigi is short for Luigi Giacomo, and that in southern Italy,
where his family is from, it is common for boys to be named after both their
paternal and maternal grandfathers, so in his case there are several Luigis in
his family.  His older cousin became Luigi grande, and he was called Luigi poco.
When the third Luigi was born, he simply took the nick name Gigi.

A second couple from our hotel joins us as we walk towards the van.  We
introduce ourselves to them as we climb aboard.  Randy and Jenny are from
Wisconsin, and like us, started their trip in Rome, and moved on to Siena.  I
wouldn't have guessed it by their looks, but they have children
our age, and two grandchildren.  At the next stop we pick up two older couples.

## Monteriggione
Our first stop on the tour is Monteriggione, a tiny hilltop town built inside a
16th century fortress.  The fortress was built as the front-line defense by
Siena, back when Siena and Florence were constantly at war.  The stone wall
around the city looks to be about 20 feet tall. Two large arched portas (gates)
provide the only access to the town, which now has a population of around 13
families.  At the center of town, a large square is home to several trattorias
and various souvenir shops.

We stop at a shop selling loom-woven sweaters. There is a small loom in the
front of the store, and several larger looms in the back.  Two older italian
ladies in the back chat while working the looms.  Monique tries on several of
the delicate wraps and finds something she likes. After being in the commercial
metropolis of Rome, it's nice to see truly handmade goods.

Before leaving Monteriggione, we share an obligatory gelato.  Cioccolato.

## Casamonti
We make our way through the winding roads of Chianti.  The landscape has changed
ever so slightly. The vast rolling hills and fields are now completely covered
in rows upon rows of grape vines and olive trees.  Occasionally there is a dense
patch of trees, or a white gravel road flanked by tall cypress trees.  Gigi
tells us that only in Chianti are cypress trees used as a symbol of wealth.
Elsewhere in Italy, they are only used in cemeteries.

We turn down a gravel road, and wind our way up towards the Casamonti gate.  The
electronic gate slides open after a quick honk of the horn.  The van parks
directly in front of the main house of Casamonti, and Anna Rita the owner stands
outside waiting to greet us.  As we gather around the front of the house, we are
joined by two Irish girls, Sinead and Nicky, who are backpacking across Europe.
Their tour van had arrived earlier and they were walking around the property.  A
server comes around with a tray of tall, skinny glasses, and we get our first
taste of Casamonti, a very light, and ever so slightly effervescent trebbiano.

Anna Rita leads us through a large wooden gate, with massive wooden doors.  To the
right is her house, where she lives with her husband and eight dogs.  One of the
dogs, a mix between a portuguese water dog and a "mongrel", follows Anna Rita like
a shadow.  When Anna Rita stops to, the dog often circles her a couple of times,
then finds a spot to lie down nearby.

Just beyond her house, she shows us the vast expanse of olive trees growing
along the hillside.  At Casamonti, they grow almost a dozen different types of
olives to create the right blend for their prized olive oil.  When harvest time
comes, they will pick the olives by hand, along with bunches of the leaves, and
transport these batches to the company that will prepare the olive oil.  She
stresses the importance of the leaves in the process.  Anything they put in
the batches will all be ground together to make the pulp for pressing.  This
includes the leaves, stems and pits.  All of these things together are what make
a great olive oil.

Casamonti is also renouned for raising an ancient breed of pig known as the
Citte-senese.  This "proto-pig", as Anna Rita calls it, is indigenous to the
region, and at one point almost extinct.  The pigs are dark gray, with a belt of
pale pink around their mid-section.  Casamonti is one of only a handful of
certified producers of citte-senese, and the largest at that. They take great
pride in being the caretakers for this ancient species, and are doing every
thing they can to ensure a clean blood-line with minimal inbreeding.  We step
into the cure house, where Anna Rita gives us a quick glance into the high-tech
refrigerators where the meat is cured.  This very modern interior, is housed
inside of a centuries old exterior that was previously a wine cellar.  In
Chianti, it is illegal to build new structures, or to change the look of
existing structures, so property owners must reappropriate the existing
buildings for new uses.  Anna Rita tells us that it is possible to build
underground structures, but as you can imagine, this is very expensive.  There
is a strong musk in the air, which we soon learn is from the natural mold that
grows on the exterior of the sausages as they cure.  This mold acts as a natural
barrier to the _bad_ bacteria and molds that would otherwise spoil the meat.

We leave rather quickly out of the cure house, the moldy stench growing ever
stronger.  Next door is the olive oil bottling room.  The room consists of a
large stainless steel vat where the processed oil is kept after it returns from
the press.  Since Casamonti only bottles the first cold press, the oil is a rich
green, and rather cloudy.  Anna Rita lifts the lid of the vat and invites us to
smell.  The aroma wafts over us.  It smells fresh and intense, more herbal than
any olive oil I've ever had before.

And finally, the main event.  We are greeted back at the main house by the same
server, this time with a refreshing ros√©.  After a brief talk about the wine, we
sit at the tables that are now set with wine glasses and plates of bruschetta
and other antipasti.  Anna Rita describes each of the items on the plate, and the
suggested order that we should indulge.  The more delicate flavors first, slowly
progressing to the intense side of the plate.  A simple slice of bread with
fresh olive oil.  A tomato and cucumber salad with spices and olive oil.  Simple
bruschetta pomodoro.  A slice of citte-senese sausage.  Bruschetta with diced
hard-boiled egg and pesto.  Bruschetta with spicy red tomato sauce.  Almost
every recipe comes from Anna Rita's grandmother.

Then she points us to the wine.  One of the two glasses at each setting has
portion of a yet to be introduced red wine.  This is the Casamonti Chianti
Classico.  To attain its (DOCG)[http://example.com/DOCG], the wine must be
comprised of no less than 85% sangiovese grapes (among other things).  Casamonti
uses 100%.  This is a very good, but unassuming Chianti classico.  I probably
could not pick this out of a lineup against other Chianti Classicos, but if
served this in a restaurant, I would be very satisfied. Next up is the 2007
Riserva. _Riserva_ in Chianti, is the hand-picked best-of-the-best from each
vineyard.  If the sangiovese in a particular year are mediocre (or worse), then
they don't produce a riserva that year.  And 2007 was certainly no mediocre
year.  This makes for a truly exceptional wine.  The bouquet has hints of dark
chocolate and tobacco, and the each sip lingers on your palate for much longer
than I expect.  Anna Rita expects this vintage to keep getting better with age for
up to 10 or 15 years.  "Wine doesn't stay around that long at my house," one of
the older ladies says.

The last wine we have is the "Super Tuscan", so called because it is the only
wine that is double fermented.  This wine is not governed by the DOCG, but
rather the much less strict IGT, meaning that the wine just has to be typical of
the region.  The super tuscans are where Chianti producers get to play around,
without the rigorous restrictions of Chianti.  This particular wine is roughly
50% merlot, 30% sangiovese and 20% others.  I'm sure we were told what the other
20% was comprised of, but at this point I am more interested in tasting than
listening.  Compared to the Chianti, the Super Tuscan is more mellow and
immediately drinkable, but with the same full body that lingers on your palate.
It tastes of dark fruit, cherries, plums and a hint of vanilla. When choosing a
favorite, our table is split between the super tuscan and the riserva.

Much too quickly, our short stint in the paradise of Casamonti comes to a close.
Anna Rita has made everyone feel like part of the family, so departing is much
like leaving a close relative's house after a short visit.  We huddle around
Anna Rita, taking pictures with her as we walk to the van.  We say good-bye to the
dog, in Anna Rita's shadow as always.

## Poggio Amorelli
We arrived at Poggio Amorelli with the quaint visit to Casamonti still fresh in
our mind. Marco is the owner and wine maker at Poggio Amorelli, but is also the
oenologist for several other chianti vineyards, including Casamonti.  Whereas
Casamonti does not ferment or cellar any of their own wine, Poggio Amorelli does
the whole thing on site.  This would give us the opportunity to get up close and
personal with the whole process.

<figure class="expand">
  <img src="/img/photos/content/poggio-grapes-closeup.jpg" />
  <figcaption>Grapes on the vine, ripe and sweet.</figcaption>
</figure>

The first room we step into at Poggio Amorelli is the fermenting room.  We are
surrounded by several large stainless steel, computer controlled fermentation
casks, and two much older wooden ones.  It turns out that the wooden ones are
much more expensive and difficult to maintain.  As little as a single day
without liquid in the cask will ruin the whole barrel, causing it to dry up and
the slats of the barrel to shrink and split.  Marco opens up a smaller plastic
holding tank containing the unfermented grapes.  The grapes inside are dark and
syrupy, and the sweet, sugary aroma lingers in the air.  The next room over is
stacked almost to the ceiling in barrels for aging.  Barrels line the room, the
one's nearest to us labeled "Vin Santo, Chianti Classico".

</figure>

The short tour comes to an end and the tasting begins.  Similar to the previous
tasting, we are treated with a white to begin with, this time a Vermentino that
Marco produces in his other vineyard near the coast.  Next up is a young,
_rosso_ that is produced in a similar fashion to the Super tuscan.  It is light
and fruity, very easy to drink, especially on a hot Tuscan day. The signature
Chianti Classico and Chianti Classico Riserva follow.  Both are very good and
typical of better Chiantis.  The Riserva is a 2008, and compared to the 2007 we
had at Casamonti, seems a little lighter in body and not as rich in flavor.  The
next sample is Marco's IGT Super Tuscan.  His is a little less merlot than the
Casamonti super tuscan (which he is also responsible for) mainly because the
Casamonti vineyard has a large hillside which is perfect for merlot.  This is
the essence of super tuscans, blending together the best of what the land will
provide.

## Castellina di Chianti
We wrap up the tour by making a short stop at Castellina di Chianti.  This is
the nearest town to the two wineries.  This is another small outpost that was
established in the time when Siena and Florence were constantly battling, but
this one was built by the Florentines.  We stroll through the tiny town center
with Gigi pointing out some of the sites.  Randy notices a local bakery, and we
buy a loaf of italian country bread to go with the sausage, cheese and wine we
bought at Poggio Amorelli.  No need to go out for dinner tonight, we'll be
having the best of Tuscany on the terrace of our hotel.  After a short walk
through town and another gelato, we head back to the hotel.
