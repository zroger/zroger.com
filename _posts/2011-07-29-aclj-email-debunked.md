This email was forwarded to my brother-in-law, who then forwarded it to me,
asking for help to figure out how much of this was the truth.

> President Obama could not be more clear, saying in his television address: 
> “If … we default, we would not have enough money to pay all of our bills — 
> bills that include monthly Social Security checks \[and\] veterans’ benefits ….”
>
> This is not only a moral outrage; it’s just not true.
> 
> Our legal analysis has concluded that there is nothing in the Constitution 
> or federal law that would prevent the President from ensuring that seniors 
> and our military heroes get the benefits they are due.
> 
> If President Obama will not make it a priority to honor our commitments to 
> those who have paid into the system their whole lives and those who have put
> their lives on the line for their country, we must urge Congress to take 
> action.  Please sign our Petition to Protect Seniors and Our Troops
> 
> Reports have shown that if we default, not only would there be money enough 
> to pay Social Security, Medicare, active duty military pay, and veterans’ 
> affairs programs, there would still be $39 billion remaining each month for 
> other essential services.
> 
> Let me be clear.  President Obama has both the legal authority and the 
> financial resources to ensure that our seniors and our military heroes 
> receive the benefits they are owed, yet he continues to use scare tactics, 
> threatening those we cherish and respect.
> 
> As our nation is faced with this impending debt crisis, our leaders in 
> Washington still have an opportunity to cut the debt and prioritize our 
> spending.  We could save billions of dollars just by cutting funding for 
> Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry, the terrorist-led Palestinian 
> Authority and other despotic governments that oppose us at every turn, and 
> pro-abortion ObamaCare.
> 
> Yet, President Obama and the liberals in Congress insist that the most 
> important cuts we could make are ending tax breaks for corporate jet owners, 
> while abortions remain a tax-deductible medical expense.
> 
> There is still time to prioritize our spending and solve our debt crisis, but
> we must send a message to Congressional leaders today.  Tell Congress to 
> support legislation that prioritizes spending, eliminates tax increases, and 
> protects seniors and our military heroes.  Sign the Petition to Protect 
> Seniors and Our Troops.
> 
> Thank you for standing with the ACLJ and taking action to protect our seniors, 
> troops, veterans, and values.  This is a critical time for the direction our 
> nation is taking, and your voice is vital in reminding Congress of America’s
> priorities.

> Sincerely,

> ACLJ Chief Counsel
