        With Digett, I created custom web sites on a team that combined high-end
        design with cutting-edge technology. For the last year I was there, we
        used Drupal exclusively as our back-end CMS. As part of Digett, I
        contributed a number of modules back to the Drupal community, attended the
        2007 Open-Source CMS summit and taught a Drupal theming workshop in
        Austin, TX.

      <p>
        At J7 I took over development of a Special Education Administration
        platform. The existing competitors in this industry were traditional
        client/server applications that had too many system requirements and
        needed a full-time system administrator. Our project presented this same
        functionality on a web-based platform. The application was built on a
        standard Linux/Apache/PHP/MySQL stack.

    <h3>NYC Drupal Happy Hour</h3>
    <p>
      Shortly after moving to New York, I began attending the regular monthly
      meet up, but wanted a more casual event.  I started the monthly Happy Hour
      as a way for industry professionals and amateurs alike to share a few
      drinks and talk about the things that intrigue us.  This Happy Hour is
      alive and strong after four years and regularly hosts crowds of over 50 geeks.

    <h3>Presentation and iOS App: Native mobile apps with Drupal</h3>

    <p>
      For the 2011 NYC Drupal Camp, I was asked to create an iOS app for the
      camp.  Along with another developer who was tasked with building the
      Android app, we decided to co-present this session about the pros and cons
      of native app development.
