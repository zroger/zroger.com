  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Phase2 Technology (formerly Treehouse Agency), New York, NY</h3>
    <p>Director of Engineering / 2010 - Present</p>

    <p>
      As Director of Engineering at Phase2 (and Treehouse), I am responsible for
      ensuring that my teams deliver the highest quality work for our clients.
      I am involved in all phases of project delivery as well as the personal
      development of team members.
    </p>

    <ul class="unstyled">
      <li>
        <h4><a href="http://energy.gov/">Energy.gov</a></h4>
        <p>
          I was the chief architect and technical analyst for this project to
          build a modern CMS for the U.S. Department of Energy.  The project
          involved the development of a custom Drupal-based CMS, migration of
          content and files off of the legacy platform, and consolidation of
          hundreds of web properties into a single platform.  This consolidation
          onto a single platform represents millions of dollars saved in hosting
          and development costs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><a href="http://thestreet.com/">TheStreet.com</a></h4>
        <p>
          I led the architecture and development of a new CMS for this Wall
          Street publishing company.  They required a modern CMS to power the
          dozens of free and subscription sites that are the core of their
          business.  My team built the first of these sites while the internal
          development team was trained and got comfortable with the new system.
          TheStreet now completely handles the development of their sites after
          a successful hand-off.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Anonymous Consumer Products Group</h4>
        <p>
          I led a multi-year re-platforming effort for a billion-dollar consumer
          products group.  The main focus of this project was to reduce the time
          and effort required to rollout new sites and redesigns.  Before this
          platform, each new site (which included all new brands, countries and
          languages) took about 6 months and required very technical personnel.
          With the new platform, only new brand sites require technical
          personnel.  Localized country sites and new languages are now simply
          content exercises.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Phase2 Project Automation</h4>
        <p>
          In an effort to increase build quality and efficiency of our projects,
          I developed a library of automation tools tailored to the types of
          projects that we do.  The current suite of tools includes PHPMD,
          PHPCS, Behat, SimpleTest and the Coder Drupal module.  These tools are
          all tied together using Rake customized for each project.  Finally, we
          have a set of standard Jenkins jobs that runs each of these Rake tasks
          and tracks the quality metrics.

    <h3>Sony Music, New York, NY</h3>
    <p>Web Engineering Team Leader / 2008 - 20010</p>

    <p>
      I was the lead developer and team leader for Sony Music's Drupal-powered
      artist website platform. The platform was a highly-evolved Drupal 6
      environment with custom modules, install profile and base themes to
      support the needs of the artists and labels. When I left in 2010, there
      were nearly 200 sites running on the platform, with around 3 sites being
      launched every week.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the major accomplishments of the platform is the vast use and
      customization of Drupal's internationalization features to provide
      localized environments for many of the sites. Some of the sites have over
      20 localized environments in over a dozen different languages. A lot of
      the work done for this platform made its way into Drupal 7.

    <h3>Churchill Downs Incorporated, Louisville, KY</h3>
    <p>Lead Web Developer / 2008, 6 month contract</p>

    <p>
      My main responsibility at Churchill Downs was building and maintaining the
      Kentucky Derby web site, and its sister site, the Kentucky Oaks, over the
      six-month racing season. This included race-day updates, maintaining the
      server environment while traffic spiked to over 3 million unique visitors.
      I was also the Drupal lead on the TwinSpires.com project, a legacy online
      wagering application using Drupal as its front-end content management
      system. I also migrated web sites for CDI’s four race tracks from a
      proprietary CMS to Drupal.

    <h3>Digett, Boerne, TX</h3>
    <p>Lead Web Developer / 2006 - 2008</p>

    <p>
      With Digett, I created custom web sites on a team that combined high-end
      design with cutting-edge technology. For the last year I was there, we
      used Drupal exclusively as our back-end CMS. As part of Digett, I
      contributed a number of modules back to the Drupal community, attended the
      2007 Open-Source CMS summit and taught a Drupal theming workshop in
      Austin, TX.

    <h3>J7 Technology, San Antonio, TX</h3>
    <p>Lead Developer / 2005 - 2006</p>

    <p>
      At J7 I took over development of a Special Education Administration
      platform. The existing competitors in this industry were traditional
      client/server applications that had too many system requirements and
      needed a full-time system administrator. Our project presented this same
      functionality on a web-based platform. The application was built on a
      standard Linux/Apache/PHP/MySQL stack.

    <h3>NYC Drupal Happy Hour</h3>
    <p>
      Shortly after moving to New York, I began attending the regular monthly
      meet up, but wanted a more casual event.  I started the monthly Happy Hour
      as a way for industry professionals and amateurs alike to share a few
      drinks and talk about the things that intrigue us.  This Happy Hour is
      alive and strong after four years and regularly hosts crowds of over 50 geeks.

    <h3>Presentation and iOS App: Native mobile apps with Drupal</h3>

    <p>
      For the 2011 NYC Drupal Camp, I was asked to create an iOS app for the
      camp.  Along with another developer who was tasked with building the
      Android app, we decided to co-present this session about the pros and cons
      of native app development.
