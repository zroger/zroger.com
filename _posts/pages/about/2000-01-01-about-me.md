<div class="eyebrow">Hello.</div>
# I'm Roger LÃ³pez.

I live, work and play in New York City. I tend to geek out about most everything, but especially the web, food, wine and cocktails.

## Work
I've been pushing the boundaries of Drupal since 2006.  I'm currently making <span title="webscale?">amazing</span> websites with the brilliant people at <a href="http://treehouseagency.com/" class="treehouse">Treehouse Agency</a>.  Previously, I worked with Sony Music, leading up a team that developed and managed almost 200 artists' websites for the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Outkast, Beyonce, Foo Fighters and many more.  Prior to that I built the Kentucky Derby website on Drupal, which had to withstand enormous amounts of traffic in the hours leading up to the race.

Although I've been solidly planted in the Drupal universe for many years, I love to keep up with new technology.  In particular, I enjoy programming in Ruby and Javascript, and integrating other technologies into Drupal.  This site, for instance, is built using Jekyll, a Ruby project for generating static blogs.

## Play
Growing up in west Texas, I have a huge appetite for mexican food (not tex-mex) and barbeque.  I enjoy all kinds of wine, and rarely ever drink the same thing twice.  I appreciate a properly made cocktail.  I spend most of my free time finding new places, hanging out at my local favorites or barbecuing on my rooftop with my lovely wife.
